# CF-Example-Project

This project is a partial re-creation of FNAC 1 made in Godot 3, using the [Cupcakes Framework](https://github.com/Oplexitie/Cupcakes-Framework/tree/main).
This was made to demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, but also showcase that you can make FNAF games in Godot.

**I will also not be expanding this, this is not meant to be a full remake, but a project I made for fun to learn more about Godot. If you want to play the full game go play the [original game](https://gamejolt.com/games/five-nights-at-candy-s-remastered/426659).**

With the exception of the Cupcakes Framework logo, every visual and audio asset were made by **Emil Macko**.
